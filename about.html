                <h1>Leon</h1>
                <p><em>Founder & Chief Analyst of Volt China</em></p>
                <hr>
                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>My journey into the world of electric vehicles wasn't just a choice; it was an immersion. Living in Guangzhou, one of the epicenters of China's automotive industry, I've had a front-row seat to the most electrifying transformation in modern transportation. I've witnessed the unprecedented pace of innovation, from the early days of skepticism to the current era where Chinese EVs are setting global benchmarks in technology, design, and ambition.</p>
                <p>This unique position allowed me to see beyond the headlines. I could feel the pulse of the industry, talk to the people behind the products, and experience these incredible machines on the roads they were designed for. It became my passion to document this revolution, not just as a series of product launches, but as a fundamental shift in technology and culture.</p>
                <h2>Why Volt China?</h2>
                <p>I founded Volt China to bridge a critical gap. While the world saw fragmented news and complex technical specifications, I saw a need for clarity, context, and deep-seated understanding. The language barrier is only the first hurdle; the real challenge is decoding the strategy, the market dynamics, and the "why" behind every decision. Machine translation can give you words, but it can't give you insight.</p>
                <p>Volt China is my answer. It's an intelligence platform built to provide precisely that: a clear, authoritative, and on-the-ground perspective. Our mission is to dismantle the wall of complexity and deliver mission-critical intelligence to global enthusiasts, industry professionals, and investors. We don't just report the news; we connect the dots.</p>
